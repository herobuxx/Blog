        Um, a month ago, my teacher told me and my classmates to work with System Monitoring.
        It was hard beacuse my teacher didn't really tell us what she actually want.
        I mean, like what is the exact result she expect us to do. 
        In the other side, i start to think why i am not making a script to show system information and easy to read.

        So, i started to write and test Akebi. At that time, i still don't know what i should call the script.
        I saw a new anime witj tje main character name is Akebi. lol.

        I am enjoying to do Akebi. It's not makes me bored because there is so many stuff to try.
        I am planning to add Multi language support for Akebi too.

      	If you want to help making Akebi being betterm feel free to do a Pul Request on the <a href="https://github.com/herobuxx/akebi">GitHub Repository</a>.
        I will review your PR and merge it once it's reviewed and tested.

      	ig that's for today xD
